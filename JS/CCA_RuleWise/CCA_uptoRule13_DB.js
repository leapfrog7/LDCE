While it\'s not common to impose two penalties simultaneously, there is no bar to awarding the penalty of recovery with another penalty.

Withholding increments for a specified period implies that all increments due during that period will be withheld, not just the first one. To withhold only one increment, the order should explicitly state that \'one increment\' is withheld for the specified period, instead of stating that the \'next increment\' is withheld.
