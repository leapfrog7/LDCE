The historical cost of an asset is the amount paid to acquire it, including any costs associated with bringing the asset into its present location and condition. For example, if a company purchases a piece of equipment for Rs 1,00,000/- including Rs 5,000/- in transportation costs, the historical cost of the equipment would be recorded as Rs 1,05,000/-.'],

This method is based on the idea that the original cost of an asset or liability is the most reliable measure of its value, as it is a tangible and objective measure that is not subject to fluctuation. \n Book value: It is a measure of an asset\'s value that is used in accounting and finance. It is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the historical cost of an asset. Book value is also known as carrying value or net book value. \n Reserve price: It is a minimum price that a seller is willing to accept for an economic item, such as a product, service, or asset, in an auction or bidding process. It is the lowest price that a seller will accept for the item and it is used as a benchmark for the bidding process. \n True Value: The true value of an economic item is the value that an asset or product holds in the market. It represents the actual worth of the item, taking into account a variety of factors such as its intrinsic value, market demand, and supply. '],
