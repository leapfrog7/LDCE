The prescribed procedure in Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules is designed to ensure compliance with the principles of justice and public policy, such as providing the accused with a reasonable opportunity to defend themselves. While the procedure should not necessarily lead to prolonged proceedings or failure to secure just punishment, several factors may contribute to delays and faulty disposals. These factors include officers being preoccupied with other duties, unfamiliarity with the procedure, delays at various stages of the inquiry, and delays in consulting the Union Public Service Commission. The Ministry suggests nominating specific officers in each Ministry or Department to conduct departmental inquiries, relieving them of other duties while they focus on the inquiries, and familiarizing them with the procedures.

The provisions of Rule 14 ibid are merely designed to ensure compliance, with a salutary principle of justice and public policy which has also been incorporated in Article 311 of the Constitution of India viz., that no man should be condemned or punished without a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The prescribed procedure therefore requires that the accused officer should be told in the form of written charges exactly what he is alleged to have done and on what evidence, oral or documentary, the allegations are based that he should have an opportunity to inspect the documentary evidence, to test the oral evidence by cross-examination and to furnish such evidence as he may wish to adduce in his own defence. If, as a result of the inquiry, it is decided that the officer should be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank, he has to be given a further opportunity to show cause, if any, against the actual punishment propose. Anything less than this would amount to denial of the reasonable opportunity which is guaranteed by Article 311.'],

The approach and objective in the criminal proceedings and disciplinary proceedings are altogether distinct and different. In the disciplinary proceedings, the question is whether the respondent is guilty of such conduct as would merit his removal from service or a lesser punishment, as the case may be, whereas in the criminal proceedings, the question is whether the offences registered against the Government servant are established and if established, what sentence can be imposed on him.

['The Departmental inquiries and criminal proceedings can be conducted simultaneously, as their objectives are distinct and different.

However, the Supreme Court has held that departmental inquiry and criminal proceedings can happen simultaneously, as their objectives are distinct. However, if the charge in the criminal case is of a grave nature which involves complicated questions of law and fact, it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case. This will depend upon the nature of offence and the evidence and material collected against the Government servant during investigation or as reflected in the charge-sheet. If the criminal case does not proceed or its disposal is being unduly delayed, the departmental proceedings, even if they were kept pending on account of the pendency of the criminal case, can be resumed and proceeded with so as to conclude them at an early date, so that if the employee is found not guilty, his honour may be vindicated and in case he is found guilty, the administration may get rid of him at the earliest, if the case so warrants. In the case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Vs. Sarvesh Berry [2004 (10) SCALE Page 340], it has been held in Para 9 that “it is not desirable to lay down any guidelines as inflexible rules in which the departmental proceedings may or may not be stayed pending trial in criminal case against the delinquent officer. Each case requires to be considered in the back drop of its own facts and circumstances. There would be no bar to proceed simultaneously with departmental inquiry and trial of a criminal case unless the charge in the criminal trial is of grave nature involving complicated questions of fact and law.” The apex court has referred to the conclusions given in Para 22 of Captain M. Paul Anthony’s case.'],
