It is thus clear that such permission is essential before a Government servant leaves his station or headquarters and more so when he proposes to go abroad during such absence, as such visit may have wider implications. However, separate permission may not be necessary where a Government servant has indicated his intention of leaving headquarters/station along with leave address while applying for leave. The leave application form prescribed under the CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972 contains necessary columns in this regard. In case the leave applied for the purpose of visiting foreign country is sanctioned, it would imply that permission for going abroad is also granted and therefore leave sanctioning authorities should keep this aspect in mind while granting the leave applied for. In the case of officers who are competent to sanction leave for themselves they should obtain permission for leaving station from their superior authority. Failure to obtain permission of competent authority before leaving station/headquarters especially for foreign visits is to be viewed seriously and may entail disciplinary action.'],
